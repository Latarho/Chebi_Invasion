# Chebi Invasion

Objective: To improve my Python skills. 

This is one of the favourite games of my childhood. 
In this project I have used the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, as the level increases in speed and difficulty also increases.


# Introduction

In Chebi Invasion, a cheburashka is present at the bottom of the screen, which can be controlled using arrow keys and spacebar.
- Right Arrow : Spaceship moves to the right.
- Left Arrow  : Spaceship moves to the left.
- Spacebar    : Spaceship shoots oranges.

Objective of the game is stop the fleet of crocodiles gena from reachng the bottom of the screen and our spaceship, if any of these happens then the player loses the cheburashka. In the game player have three extra cheburashkas.

# Requirements
