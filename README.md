# Chebi Invasion

Objective: To improve my Python skills. 

This is one of the favourite games of my childhood. 
In this project I have used the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, as the level increases in speed and difficulty also increases.


# Introduction

In Chebi Invasion, a cheburashka is present at the bottom of the screen, which can be controlled using arrow keys and spacebar.
- Right Arrow : Spaceship moves to the right.
- Left Arrow  : Spaceship moves to the left.
- Spacebar    : Spaceship shoots oranges.
